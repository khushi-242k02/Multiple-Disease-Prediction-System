# Multiple Disease Prediction System

This project focuses on building a multiple disease prediction system that provides real-time predictions for heart disease, diabetes, and Parkinson’s disease. Utilizing machine learning models like Logistic Regression and Support Vector Machines (SVM), the system offers accurate disease predictions through an interactive UI created with Streamlit, deployed locally for user-friendly real-time interaction.

The goal of the project is to offer accessible, accurate, and easy-to-use tools for individuals or healthcare providers to assess the risk of these diseases quickly.

## Key Features:

- **Interactive User Interface:** Developed using *Streamlit*, allowing users to input relevant data and receive real-time predictions. The system is deployed locally, ensuring smooth interaction and immediate feedback.
  
- **Heart Disease Prediction:** 
  - Model: *Logistic Regression*.
  - Achieved an accuracy rate of *81.96%*.
  - Provides users with a probabilistic estimate of their heart disease risk based on input features such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and more.

- **Diabetes Prediction:** 
  - Model: *Support Vector Machine (SVM)*.
  - Reached an accuracy of *77.27%*.
  - Designed to predict the likelihood of diabetes by analyzing features like glucose levels, BMI, insulin levels, and other related factors.

- **Parkinson's Disease Prediction:** 
  - Model: *Support Vector Machine (SVM)*.
  - Achieved a high accuracy of *87.17%*.
  - Detects Parkinson’s disease by analyzing vocal data and other medical features to assess the likelihood of the condition.

- **Real-Time Predictions:** The system provides instant results based on user inputs, enhancing its practical utility for end-users.

- **Deployable Locally:** Runs locally, ensuring data privacy and a smooth, responsive user experience without dependence on external servers.

The project showcases the power of machine learning models in healthcare applications, providing a valuable tool for disease prediction with significant accuracy across multiple conditions.
